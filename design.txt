
objects:
    1. conveyor belt:
        a: Has a capacity for n components, defined by setting CONVEYOR_BELT_COMPONENT_ALLOWED_NUM. For this challeng use a value of 3.
        b: Belt speed is n Slots, defined by setting CONVEYOR_BELT_SPEED_BY_SLOTS. We will use a speed of 1.

    2. worker:
        a: For each component slots on the conyeyor belt, there will be two workers.
        b: Workers are positioned either side of the conveyor belt (opposite each other), we will call WA1 worker A in slot 1, WB2 - worker B in slot 2.  
        c: Workers pick from the same slot.
            rule1: WA(n) and WB(n) are not allowed to pick from the same slot in the same Event.
            rule2: Worker may place a Product into an empty slot, 4 Events after picking the second component. defined by setting PRODUCT_CONSTRUCTION_SPEED_BY_SLOTS.
            rule3: Workers may only hold two items  (Component A + Component B)  xor Product.
            rule4: Workers may only pick a single Component A or a single Componet B.
            

    3. component:
        a:  Component A
        b:  Component B 
        c:  Product  (finnished component)
            

    4. Event:
        a: Time component measure in natural number, 0 = Time has not started. 1 = the first event.
        b: Run simulation for 100 events.  defined by MAX_NUMBER_EVENTS, Set to 100. Therefor the last event will be 100.

    5. Statistics:
        a: compute the number of Products, finished from the conveyor belt.
        b: compute the number of wasted components, from the conveyor belt.


    6. Persitant Values:
        -   CONVEYOR_BELT_COMPONENT_ALLOWED_NUM : 5,
        -   CONVEYOR_BELT_SPEED_BY_SLOTS : 1,
        -   PRODUCT_CONSTRUCTION_SPEED_BY_SLOTS : 4,
        -   MAX_NUMBER_EVENTS : 100,
        -   COMPONENT_TYPES : ( A , B )
        -   ALLOWED_COMPONENTS_TYPES : ( A , B, PRODUCT )
